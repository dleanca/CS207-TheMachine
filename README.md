* **/build** - Files that are compiled and ready to run / upload.
* **/libraries** - Any libraries that are needed to build your software for your device.
* **/examples** - Example files that can be run on your hardware.
* **/img** - This is where the image files for this readme are! Yay!
* **/LICENSE** - The license file.
* **/README.md** - The file you're reading now! :-D
