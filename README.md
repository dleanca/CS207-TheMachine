# CS207-TheMachine
This repository is used for tracking the progress of the final project for the CS207 class.



# Repository Contents

* **/src** - This is where you can find the code that needs to be uploaded on the arduino (.ino).
* **/hardware** - All the PCB design files  and needed 3D models (.ftz, .stl).
* **/img** - This is where the image files for this readme are!
* **/LICENSE** - The license file.
* **/README.md** - The file you're reading now! xD

# Requirements and Materials
No additional libraries are needed except ones that are readily available in arduino
<liquidCrystal.h>
<Servo.h>

# Bill of Materials:
* 4x push buttons
* 1x 10k potentiometer
* 1x Arduino Uno
* 1x Nema 17 Stepper Motor with the extruder adapter installed
* 1x 4988 Stepper driver board
* 1x 9 or 12V power supply
* 1x DC to DC variable power converter
* 1x 1602 Character LCD display
* jumper wires
* 1x High torque Servo motor (270 degrees of rotation)

# Build Instructions:


# Firmware Installation
  No special steps are needed for the installation.
  With that said, make sure the correct port is selected in the arduino IDE!

# The build team consists of:

* Denis Leanca - Yup. just Moi. xD

# Credits
* EscapeClubEscapeRooms - letting me have a stepper motor and other misc items.
* IEEE - for allowing me to use their spare extruder and 3d printer (after it being fixed by yours truly xD)
